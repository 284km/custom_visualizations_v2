# Subtotal

![](subtotal.png)

This visualization groups query results by measures and pivots and allows collapsing/expanding of those groups.

**How it works**

Create a look with at least one dimension and one measure.

For example, in the example above, we have grouped products by category and brand and by the year they were ordered. We've also pivoted by department to show the number of orders of those products by department. Row totals appear on the right side of the table.
